# Data Structures in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of fundamental data structures.  
Each structure is implemented from scratch and includes example test cases.

## Current Implementations

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List (upcoming)
3. Stack (upcoming)
4. Queue (upcoming)
5. Binary Tree (upcoming)
6. Graph (upcoming)

## 1. Singly Linked List

**File:** `SinglyLinkedListDemo.java`  
A basic singly linked list implementation with standard operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Implemented Methods

| Method | Description | Time Complexity |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| `addFirst(int val)` | Adds an element at the beginning | O(1) |
| `addLast(int val)` | Adds an element at the end | O(n) |
| `insertAfter(int target, int val)` | Inserts a new node after a given value | O(n) |
| `removeFirst()` | Removes the first element | O(1) |
| `removeLast()` | Removes the last element | O(n) |
| `remove(int val)` | Removes a specific element by value | O(n) |
| `printList()` | Prints the entire list | O(n) |

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Java installed (`java -version`)
2. Compile the file:
   ```bash
   javac SinglyLinkedListDemo.java
3. Run the File
   ```bash
    java SinglyLinkedListDemo
